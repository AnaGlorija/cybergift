# cyberGift

Gift for Ethereum users that will maximize the initial usage of Cyber by the following audiences:

- true heroes of the Great Web
- masters of the Great Web
- extraordinary hackers
- average citizens
- passionate investors
- key opinion leaders
- inborn entrepreneurs
- cyberpunks  

The purpose of the research is to incentivize and inspire (at least 100k) the most web3 power-users to try out Cyber.

Ethereum addresses have to be labeled by the audiences and differentiated into three power grades for every audience in such a way to create also non-fungible tokens.

The research results have to be in the form of reproducible scripts that will be pull requested in the [launch-kit](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit), and an article with the rationale of the gift structure.

Research is done on the [proposal](https://cyber.page/governance/20) basis.
