# cyberGift

Gift for Ethereum users that will maximize the initial usage of Cyber by the following audiences:

- true heroes of the Great Web
- masters of the Great Web
- extraordinary hackers
- average citizens
- passionate investors
- key opinion leaders
- inborn entrepreneurs
- cyberpunks  

The purpose of the research is to incentivize and inspire (at least 100k) the most web3 power-users to try out Cyber.

Ethereum addresses have to be labeled by the audiences and differentiated into three power grades for every audience 
in such a way to create also non-fungible tokens.

The research results have to be in the form of reproducible scripts that will be pull requested in the 
[launch-kit](https://github.com/cybercongress/launch-kit), and an article with the rationale of the gift structure.

Data source is [BigQuery crypto-ethereum dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?d=crypto_ethereum&p=bigquery-public-data&page=dataset&project=cosmic-keep-223223) 
by [Blockchain ETL](https://github.com/blockchain-etl).

Research is done on the [proposal](https://cyber.page/governance/20) basis.

## Extraordinary Hackers. Gas Analysis

To search for **Extraordinary Hackers** who have created the Ethereum ecosystem, I will be aggregate the used gas by creators of contracts and factories.  
To do this, I want to calculate an amount of gas used for contracts calls.
